# Introduction to Data Pipelines Autumn 2023

Welcome to the 2-day course on data pipelines.

## Setup

Throughout the course, all content will be delivered using MacOS and VSCode. If you're using Windows or Linux, or if you want to use another IDE, that's no problem.

In order to minimize time spent debugging setup and package issues, please download and install python and VSCode using the [instructions from their website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/python-install-vscode/).

You'll also need to install the python and jupyter extensions in VSCode. It would also be a good idea to set up a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

Next, download and install Poetry using the [instructions from their website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

Next, navigate to the github repo for the course and download everything. You can either clone the repo or just download the zip file, up to you. If you want to download, click the green ' <> Code ' drop down and select "Download ZIP".

We'll be using virtual environments for each of the labs but there is a list of packages that we'll be using in the `requirements.txt` file, just in case you want to get familiar with them before Monday.
